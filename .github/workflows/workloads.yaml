# This workflow will be triggered on every PR to the 'main' branch
on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # manual
  pull_request:
    branches:
    - main

jobs:
  # We will have a single job for running the data tests
  run-data-test:
    # Use the latest version of Ubuntu provided by GitHub for our runner
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository's code
      # This allows the workflow to access your workloads.sh and other files
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up the Python environment
      # We'll use Python 3.10
      - name: Set up Python 3.10
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.10.11'

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      # This step assumes you have a requirements.txt file in your repository
      # It's crucial for the Python scripts to have the necessary libraries
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      # Step 4: Run the data test from workloads.sh
      # We make the script executable first.
      # Then, we run the script but override the flags within it by setting
      # environment variables. This ensures ONLY the data test is run.
